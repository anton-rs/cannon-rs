## What's a Cannon?

Cannon is an emulator designed to simulate a single MIPS thread context on the EVM. Its primary use is to execute the [`op-program`][op-program]
(also known as the fault-proof program) for the [OP Stack][monorepo]'s interactive dispute protocol. The `op-program` consists
of a stripped down version of `op-geth`'s state transition code in addition to the derivation pipeline, and produces deterministic results.
Subsequently, it is compiled to MIPS to be ran on top of Cannon on-chain to prove fault in claims about the state of L2 on L1. Cannon also has a
native implementation of the MIPS thread context that mirrors the on-chain version, which enables the [op-challenger][op-challenger] to generate
state commitments for an `op-program` execution trace and participate in dispute games.

*TL;DR:*
* It's Rust code
* ...that was [originally Go code][cannon]
* ...that runs an EVM
* ...emulating a MIPS machine
* ...running [compiled Go code][op-program]
* ...that runs an EVM

## Overview
* [`cannon-mipsevm`](./crates/mipsevm) - Contains the native implementation of the MIPS thread context emulator.
* [`preimage-oracle`](./crates/preimage) - Rust bindings for interacting as client or sever over the Pre-image Oracle ABI.
* [`cannon-contracts`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/cannon) - [*in OP monorepo*] Contains the Solidity implementation of the MIPS thread context and the Preimage Oracle.

## Credits

This repository is heavily inspired by the original [Cannon][cannon], built by [George Hotz][geohot] and members of the [OP Labs][op-labs] team. The original implementation is written in Go, and can be found [in the Optimism monorepo][cannon]. All
credits for the original idea and reference implementation of this concept go to these folks.

## Benchmarks

### `cannon-mipsevm` benchmarks

The below benchmark was ran on a 2021 Macbook Pro with an M1 Max and 32 GB of unified memory
on commit [`71b68d5`](https://github.com/anton-rs/cannon-rs/pull/17/commits/71b68d52fb858cfc544c1430b482aeaef460552e).

| Benchmark Name             | `cannon` mean (Reference) | `cannon-rs` mean    |
|----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| Memory Merkle Root (25MB)  | 736.94 ms                 | 29.58 µs (-99%)     |
| Memory Merkle Root (50MB)  | 1.54s                     | 7.25 ms (-99%)      |
| Memory Merkle Root (100MB) | 3.34s                     | 273.76 ms (-91.8%)  |
| Memory Merkle Root (200MB) | 6.30s                     | 1.65s (-73.81%)     |

cargo nextest run --all --all-features
# Without `cargo-nextest`
cargo t --all --all-features
```

### Linting and Formatting

```sh
cargo +nightly fmt --all -- && cargo +nightly clippy --all --all-features -- -D warnings
```

### Running Benchmarks

```sh
cargo bench --all --all-features
```

## Documentation

Rustdocs are available by running `cargo doc --open` after cloning the repo.

### Specification

The specification for both Cannon and the preimage oracle can be found in the [Optimism monorepo][monorepo].
